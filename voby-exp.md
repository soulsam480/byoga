### Voby experience

### Good

- fancy and looks cool

### Bad

- extremely confused on following things
  - useResource => not sure how to read return values to render UI
    ```tsx
    <p>resource().error === undefined ? 'Nice':'L'</p>
    ```
  - The code snippet above doesn't work
  - sometimes the function passed to useResource doesn't even run

### Status

- getting rid of voby and planning to use preact signals
- voby's been extremely unpredictable
